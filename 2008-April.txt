Subject: [Sonata-announce] Sonata 1.5 Released
Message-ID: <35a6f8e30804031651w2ae8de8cv1274b6ef2d85bd04@mail.gmail.com>

Sonata 1.5 Released

This release includes quite a lot of changes - most notably, it uses a
new python interface called python-mpd that was written by jat.
Python-mpd will not come bundled with sonata like mpdclient*.py was,
so take note of this new dependency. You should notice a nice speedup
from using it as it was written from scratch and is much faster than
the previous interface. Other than this, there are a smattering of
interface improvements and bugfixes. Thanks as always to all patch
writers, bug reporters, translators, etc.
