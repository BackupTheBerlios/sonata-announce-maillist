Sonata 1.5.1 Released

Mostly a maintenance release. For those of you that use shuffle or
random, note the swap below. Sonata's inconsistency with MPD, which
always confused be in the code, stemmed back from Pygmy days.

 CHANGELOG

  + Swap 'shuffle' and 'random' to be consistent with MPD
  + "Save list to">"foo" can now either replace playlist or append songs
  + Add Catalan translation (Franc)
  + Add Arabic translation (Ahmad)
  + Bug: Fix play/pause with multimedia keys (Vinay)
  + Bug: Prevent possible traceback from gobject.filename_from_utf8
  + Bug: 'play after replace' when in shuffle mode plays 1st song, not random
  + Bug: Fix random, repeat, and toggle commands from console
  + Bug: Songs not tagged with the album name don't show up
  + Bug: Cannot disconnect when MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT are set
  + Bug: Fix %D and %N formats within brackets
