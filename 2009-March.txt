Subject: [Sonata-announce] Sonata 1.6 Released
Message-ID: <35a6f8e30903291130o1acca4faocadb1076b12ddbbe@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Sonata 1.6 has now been released with a host of new features, interface
improvements, and backend refactorings. The album browsing mode is back, all
the library views have been enhanced with details and album artwork, the
library tab has real-time search as you type, and there is a fullscreen
album art mode. See the changelog for the full list of changes.

Huge thanks goes to Tuukka Hastrup, who helped enormously to refactor the
Sonata codebase and is now an official developer, and Stephen Boyd, who has
submitted a large number of bugfix/cleanup patches. Also finally, thanks to
all the individual patch writers, bug reporters, and translators.
