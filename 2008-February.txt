Sonata 1.4.1 Released

Mostly a bug fix release. Re-ordering of the playlist should also be
much improved (especially re-ordering multiple songs at the same
time), and note that queue support has been unfortunately removed.

CHANGELOG

* Remove queue support (it was removed from mpd-svn, complain to them)
* Improved re-ordering of playlist songs (including multiple selected songs)
* Add album info into info tab
* Use hand2 instead of hand1 for song info links
* Bug: Traceback can occur after enabling audioscrobbler
* Bug: Text background color on tabs (ecik)
* Bug: Visible background of eventboxes for info tab links, etc.
* Bug: Can't click (more) link in non-English locales
* Bug: Crash when using libegg with system tray icon disabled
* Bug: Disable tag editing link in info tab for streams/remote files
* Bug: Unescape common html codes from lyrics fetching, enable formatting
* Bug: The main notebook should be scrollable

Another mostly bugfix release. I've never gotten so many bug reports
and emails over a single bug before (inability to seek in the progress
bar) :-P

* Better handling if no read permission (e.g. no/bad mpd password supplied)
* Bug: Fix seeking in progress bar
* Bug: Fix blank album info when there is an ampersand
* Bug: Missing color in notification window
* Bug: Notebook arrow clicks are ignored due to gtk bug
* Bug: Potential ordering bug when sorting via column heading click
* Bug: Make desktop file compliant
* Bug: Column widths can collapse when exiting while minimized to the tray
