Subject: [Sonata-announce] Sonata 1.1 Released
Message-ID: <35a6f8e30705072152q7fe6f39at8f58b3d5dfabd27c@mail.gmail.com>

Sonata 1.1 Released

Some new features, bug fixes, interface improvements.. Note that you
are going to be seeing a warning about egg.trayicon being deprecated,
this is safe to ignore. I have filed a bug report[1] about whether it
should indeed be deprecated, so I have not yet removed the code from
Sonata.

CHANGELOG

    * Ctrl-J for xmms-like search filter (vEX/Eduard)
    * Implemented logic for Various Artists albums
    * Cover art pref: save to ~/.covers or file's respective dir
    * Support for GNOME session management
    * Allow searching through ALL metadata in library
    * Link artist and album name in song info window to wikipedia entry
    * Add shuffle, repeat, --visible, and --hidden commandline arguments
    * Show if mpd is updating in statusbar
    * Save last used option in library search
    * Update code for dbus-python 0.80 API (Jordan)
    * Ellipsize text in treeviews, current playing song (Jordan)
    * Add button for listing of shortcuts to About dialog
    * Resize cover art to fit song info window
    * Added Simplified Chinese translation (Desmond Chang)
    * Bug: Prevent tracebacks between withdrawing app & gtk.StatusIcon
    * Bug: Fix error if mpd is not running and sonata starts hidden
    * Bug: Can't manually set artwork across filesystems
    * Bug: Can't use find-as-you-type in the current playlist
    * Bug: Right-click menu closes right away for some users
