Sonata 1.0 Released

Many new features, improvements, and an important bug fix. Note that
there are quite a few changes to the dependencies: 1) for system tray
support, gnome-python-extras OR PyGTK 2.10.x is needed, 2) for tag
editing support, Taglib and tagpy are needed, and 3) for automatic
lyrics retrieval support, SOAPpy is needed. All of these dependencies
are optional.

- Editing of song tags (requires optional taglib & tagpy)
