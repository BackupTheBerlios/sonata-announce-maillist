Sonata 1.2.3 Released

This release contains another decently big artwork related bugfix that
should improve the automatic artwork fetching's ability to find a
cover. It also should see significantly less cpu usage, as discovered
by powertop. Thanks as always for all bug reports, translations,
patches, etc.

CHANGELOG

* Incorporate disc tag in album sorting (Emmanuel Viaud)
* Significantly reduced wakeups/sec according to powertop
* Add stream name as a formatting option
* Added Italian translation (Gianni Vialetto)
* Added Swedish translation (Daniel Nylander)
* Added Dutch translation (Olivier)
* Bug: Stupid parsing of amazon URLs, reduced success of cover art fetching
* Bug: Default cover remains after refetching when not using ~/.covers
* Bug: Czech translation incorrectly labeled Swedish
* Bug: Song played after a replace is first in list, even in shuffle mode
* Bug: Collapsed view doesn't work properly in some WMs (e.g. Fluxbox)
* Bug: Display 'update library' menu item even when library is empty
